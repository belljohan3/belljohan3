# Hi there, I'm Johan Bell! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a passionate and versatile web developer, capable of handling all stages of advanced web development. I have knowledge in UI, debugging and MVC programming. I currently work as a frontend developer at Tredco, an innovative construction company.

 At Tredco, I participate in the development of a web application that helps construction team users. The app uses AI to generate quotes, manage customers and provide other features. Visit: https://tredco.no for more information. 

Previously, I interned as a frontend developer at Flowcraft, where I also worked on a web application related to the construction industry. At the same time, I carried out several freelance projects, using tools such as Tailwind CSS, Directus and VueJs. I am done my general baccalaureate in English language and literature at the Highschool Ngousso-Ngoulmekong.

 I am motivated by continuous learning and improving my web development skills. I am able to quickly learn the latest tools and procedures in the field. I also have a good team spirit and a sense of the problem. My goal is to create effective, attractive web solutions tailored to user needs. I am always looking for new challenges and new opportunities to showcase my creativity and versatility.
